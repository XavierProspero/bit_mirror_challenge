# bit_mirror_challenge
A short program that will mirror the bits in an integer. 


## Logic
I solved this challenge in both a hard coded iterative way and a recursive way. 
The idea in both is the same. Break up the problem into halves and flip those halves. 
This works because 32 is a power of two. 
By using this technique I am able to do this in O(logn) time.
